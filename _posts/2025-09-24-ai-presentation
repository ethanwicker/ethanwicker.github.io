I recently presented at a company-wide all-hands on how AI works, how we got here, and a bit on where we're going.  Only an understanding of simple linear algebra was needed to grasp the learning outcomes.  I highted three key concepts for how AI works:

- Numbers in, numbers
- Simple linear equations
- Scale

Of course, this is a vast oversimplification.  [See the slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bEYwSNaiby4C4gYdwMZlwDRNtddi76ofyKOayXSVbpE/edit?usp=sharing).
