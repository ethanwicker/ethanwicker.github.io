Hi, I'm Ethan. ðŸ‘‹ I'm a Data Scientist living in Denver, CO.  I'm also a former high school AP Statistics and mathematics teacher.  I write mostly about AI, ML, learning analytics, and educational technology, but sometimes other topics too.

I have a BS in Mathematics, a BS in Mathematics Education, and a minor in Philosophy.  At NC State University, I was selected as a [Noyce Mathematics Education Teaching Scholar](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0733794&HistoricalAwards=false), a program that seeks to increase the number of highly qualified teachers in high-needs public schools.  I loved my time teaching, but realized it wasn't my path to long-term happiness, so I made the difficult decision to leave the profession.

I taught myself to code and studied statistics, machine learning, and software engineering on my nights and weekends.  Along the way, I've worked in telecommunications, logistics, and smart home automation, and have even being fortunate enough to [earn a couple patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Ethan+Wicker).  I've built and led analytical teams, trained and deployed production models, and have worked with some truly wonderful, bright, and inspiring people.

But...the educator in me misses the impact I found teaching.  I've been plotting to break into EdTech for years, and I'm on a mission to make that dream happen.  Opportunity is abundant, but it is not evenly distributed.  I'm on a mission to change the world by combining analytics, data science, and education, one student learning outcome at a time.
