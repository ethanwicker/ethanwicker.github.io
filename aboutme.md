Hi, I'm Ethan.  I'm a Data Scientist living in Denver, CO.

In a past life, I was a high school AP Statistics and mathematics teacher, but now I work in anomaly detection.  

After being an R user for several years, I made the switch to using Python as my analytics tool of choice, but I still use both languages depending on the problem at hand.  I hold a BS in Mathematics, a BS in Mathematics Education and a Minor in Philosophy, all from North Carolina State University.  In addition to my formal degrees, I've taught myself the majority of my advanced statistics and machine learning knowledge.  I've used a variety of online resources and textbooks for this.

Aside from data science, I enjoy trail running in the Rocky Mountains, live music, and coffee - sometimes all in the same day.
