I'm Ethan.  I'll come back and update this later.

Note to self, I should add a picture of myself here, and maybe my resume.

As well as my a bit about my background, my degrees, and that I work in anomaly detection.

Should also call out that many of my initial posts are inspired by Introduction to Statistical Learning, and many of the formulas are taken from it (which version of book?)

BS in Mathematics,
BS in Mathematics Education,
Minor in Philosophy ,

Denver, CO

And what I do for fun - trailing running, music etc.
