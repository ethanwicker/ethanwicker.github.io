I recently read through Chip Huyen's (*Designing Machine Learning Systems*)[https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/]

The structure of this post was influenced by the third chapter of *An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R* by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani.

$$
\begin{aligned} 
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_pX_p + \epsilon 
\end{aligned}
$$
