Hi, I'm Ethan. 👋 I'm the Director of Analytics at [Nectir](https://www.nectir.io/).  I'm also a former high school AP Statistics and mathematics teacher.  I write mostly about AI, ML, learning analytics, and educational technology.

I have a BS in Mathematics, a BS in Mathematics Education, and a minor in Philosophy.  At NC State University, I was selected as a [Noyce Mathematics Education Teaching Scholar](https://www.nsfnoyce.org/){:target="_blank"}, a program that seeks to increase the number of highly qualified teachers in high-needs public schools.  I loved my time teaching, but realized it wasn't my path to long-term happiness, so I made the difficult decision to leave the profession.

I taught myself to code and studied statistics, machine learning, and software engineering on my nights and weekends.  Along the way, I've worked in telecommunications, logistics, smart home automation, and educational technology.  I've been fortunate enough to [earn a couple patents](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Ethan+Wicker){:target="_blank"} and [publish educational research](https://openpraxis.org/articles/10.55982/openpraxis.17.2.772).  My work has been mentioned in [EdTech Digest](https://www.edtechdigest.com/2025/08/07/lapu-research-shows-ai-powered-course-assistants-increased-student-gpa-by-7-5/) and [The AI Journal](https://aijourn.com/nectir-and-lapu-find-targeted-edtech-ai-can-improve-student-gpas-by-7-5-in-peer-reviewed-study/).  I've built and led analytical teams, trained and deployed production models, and have worked with some truly wonderful, bright, and inspiring people.

Opportunity is abundant, but is not evenly distributed.  I'm on a mission to change the world by combining analytics, machine learning, data science, AI, and education, one student learning outcome at a time.
